## Description

This project is a robust Node.js application built with TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB, integrated with Python for advanced processing capabilities. It leverages modern tools and services like Cloudinary, Stripe, Firebase, and Socket.IO to provide a scalable backend solution. The project includes a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment to a GoDaddy VPS using Docker.

## Project Setup

```bash
$ npm install

## Compile and run the project

# Development mode with TypeScript
$ npm run dev

# Build the project
$ npm run build

# Production mode
$ npm run start:prod

## Run tests

# Placeholder for tests (currently undefined)
$ npm test

## Deployment

The project is containerized using Docker and deployed via a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to a GoDaddy VPS. To deploy manually, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then follow these steps:

Set up environment variables: Create a .env file with the required variables as defined in docker-compose.yml (e.g., MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.).

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

With GoDaddy VPS, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
